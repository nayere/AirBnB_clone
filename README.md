# AirBnB_clone
This is a sole project for AirBnB_clone 
Tasks
0. README, AUTHORS
mandatory
Write a README.md:
description of the project
description of the command interpreter:
how to start it
how to use it
examples
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference Docker’s AUTHORS page
You should use branches and pull requests on GitHub - it will help you as team to organize your work
Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone
File: README.md, AUTHORS
 
1. Be pycodestyle compliant!
mandatory
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.


  
2. Unittests
mandatory
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests


  
3. BaseModel
mandatory
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:


  
4. Create BaseModel from dictionary
mandatory
Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

Now it’s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
Update models/base_model.py:

__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
you will use *args, **kwargs arguments for the constructor of a BaseModel. (more information inside the AirBnB clone concept page)
*args won’t be used
if kwargs is not empty:
each key of this dictionary is an attribute name (Note __class__ from kwargs is the only one that should not be added as an attribute. See the example output, below)
each value of this dictionary is the value of this attribute name
Warning: created_at and updated_at are strings in this dictionary, but inside your BaseModel instance is working with datetime object. You have to convert these strings into datetime object. Tip: you know the string format of these datetime

  
5. Store first object
mandatory
Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation:

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.
So, you will convert the dictionary representation to a JSON string. JSON is a standard representation of a data structure. With this format, humans can read and all programming languages have a JSON reader and writer.


  
6. Console 0.0.1
mandatory
Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:


  
7. Console 0.1
mandatory
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands:


  
8. First User
mandatory
Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel:

models/user.py
Public class attributes:
email: string - empty string
password: string - empty string
first_name: string - empty string
last_name: string - empty string
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of User.

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow show, create, destroy, update and all used with User.

  
9. More classes!
mandatory
Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel:


  
10. Console 1.0
mandatory
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.

Enjoy your first console!

No unittests needed for the console
